// 1. Declare a variable called `firstName` and assign it your first name as a string:
let firstName = 'Genesis';

// 2. Declare a variable called `lastName` and assign it your last name as a string:
let lastName = 'Gabiola';

// 3. Declare a variable called `age`:
let age;

// 4. Print out the `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age` variables. What do you
//    expect them to be when they get printed?
console.log(firstName, lastName, age); // Genesis Gabiola undefined

// 5. Assign the `age` variable to a number:
age = 29;

// 6. Print out the `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age` variables. What do you
//    expect them to be when they get printed?
console.log(firstName, lastName, age); // Genesis Gabiola 29
