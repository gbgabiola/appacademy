# Introduction

- programming is fundamentally about computer instructions with the goal of solving a problem
- communicate with computers using code while solving problems
- in proramming you'll get a lot of things wrong, and it's pretty normal, every programmer went through this process
- learn a lot from your mistakes
- to become a better programmer, we must program
- don't just watch videos, work on the practice problems
- make sure you can write and understand the problem/solution before moving on
- `puts` is used to print text `puts "Hello World"`
- order and output of the code is top to bottom
- `#` or hash is used to comment out the text and computer ignores it
- comments are also used to describe certain codes
