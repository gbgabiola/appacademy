# Strings

- strings is one of the data types in Ruby and in programming in general
- 3 ways to print or display output
  1. `print` will do minimal formatting and not even add a new line at the end of the print
  2. `puts` will print data with some formatting, including a new line after every puts
  3. `p` prints data with a new line but also gives information on type of data
     - able to differentiate the string `"42"` and number `42`
- `\n` stands for "new line".
- `\t` stands for "tab".
- everything inside quotes (`" "`) or (`' '`) is a string
- it doesn't matter if we wrap a string in double quotes or single quotes
- `.length` to get the number of characters
- `.length - 1` to get the last character of string
- every characters in a string has an index (position), which starts counting at zero
- `[0]` index to get the first character of string
- indices always start to count at `0`
- `+` operator can also use to concatenate another string: `"Hello " + "World"`
