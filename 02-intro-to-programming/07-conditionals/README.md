# Conditionals

- conditional allows you to run different code under different circumstances, making your code more dynamic
- condition must be an expression that evaluates to `true` or `false` which is a **boolean**
- conditional starts with an `if` and end with an `end`
- `else` will be `true` if the first condition is `false`
- `elsif` for additional conditions to check
- condtional will always check the first condition if it's true it will execute it and skip the other conditions
  - meaning `else` or `elsif` makes the conditions exclusive

**Note**: `return` keyword belongs to the `if` statement, don't forget the indentation
